AIpy is a open-source framework designed to be fully modular and upgradeable by the community. It is meant to be a cheap alternative to cobot like Baxter (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baxter_(robot)), who isn't affordable for makers. It is design to be the ultimate tool for you, in which he can use many different tools, like a laser, a grapple or a a suction cup for handeling flat object, like copper sheets or paper documents.
