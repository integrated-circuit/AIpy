# AIpy:

AIpy is a open-source framework designed to be fully modular and upgradeable by the community. It is meant to be a cheap alternative to cobot like [Baxter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baxter_(robot)>), who isn't affordable for makers. It is design to be the ultimate tool for you, in which he can use many different tools, like a laser, a grapple or a a suction cup for handeling flat object, like copper sheets or paper documents.
The robot is powered by servomotors controlled by the GPIOzero library who allows to control hardware connected to GPIO pins.

It is divided in 3 sub-repositories:

- [AIpy-GUI-Linux](https://github.com/integrated-circuit/AIpy-GUI), which contain a more complex description of the the User Interface and a release for Linux.
- [AIpy-GUI-Windows](https://github.com/integrated-circuit/AIpy-GUI-Windows), same as AIpy-GUI-Linux, but contains a release for Windows.
- [AIpy](https://github.com/integrated-circuit/AIpy), the main repository, where all the main releases of AIpy OS and program for Raspberry pi are.
